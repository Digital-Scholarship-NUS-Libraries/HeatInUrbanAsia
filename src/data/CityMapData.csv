1820,,,,,,,,"The first temperature and wind observations made in the Malayan peninsula were by officers of the British East India Company. They left no record of rainfall, probably because they were using measuring instruments from their ships, which did not carry rain gauges. The EIC had an interest in studying the local weather to explore the viability of making a permanent settlement. After a settlement was established, doctors quickly took an interest in making weather observations,  concerned about the 'healthiness' of the region for European colonisation and linking good weather with good health (Ward, 1830).

1869,,,,,,,,"In 1869, meteorology for the Straits Settlements was brought under the control of the Medical Department for historic and practical reasons. Firstly, the interest in medical meteorology, a field of medical research that based its investigations on connections between health and weather, grew in the 19th century. As the century progressed, a quantitative method of comparing diseases incidence with meteorological data became common across the colonies of the British Empire (e.g. Walker, 1876, 1925). Secondly, the medical department also offered a coherent infrastructure for the systematic collation of observations within a controlled environment.

This hospital was originally intended to hold transported prisoners (mainly of Indian origin) from other British colonies. The weather data is very detailed and standardised, observations made 3 times a day. 
<br/>
Despite the detailed records, little in known about the small-scale observatory or who made the records. The prison itself was designed and established by George Coleman, Superintendent of Public Works and of Convicts. There was an open plan area with numerous workshops and studio, one of which was presumably an observatory space (McNair & Bayliss, 1889). 
<br/>
Coleman handed operations to his successor, Major John Fedrick McNair, also a prominent architect and engineer. McNair may have supervised a subordinate or even a trusted prisoner to make the observations but they were ultimately signed off by the Colonial Surgeon, H.L. Randall. 
In 1867, the practice of transporting prisoners ended and six years later, so did the observations from this hospital.","<a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/sh/q6qzwclwvy30dkg/AACtvLyJn7IgIZmv5BZ3Pqr7a/Singapore%201869-1874%20Convict%20Hospital?dl=0&preview=Singapore+1869-1876+digit.xlsx&subfolder_nav_tracking=1"">Principal Civil Medical Officer (P.C.M.O) of

Population increased from 4.02 million to 5.07 million in just 10 years (2000-2010). More infrastructure such as transport and buildings (for housing and business) was also in place. Following the 2001 Concept Plan, the urban center in downtown was decentralised to the western region, and new buildings were still being built in mature estates such as Queenstown and Redhill but with more density and at greater heights (URA, 2001). Development partly  resulted in higher temperatures being recorded in the east, west and north regions of Singapore due to the UHI effect.
<br/>
The 2001 Concept Plan also draw a focus to greening Singapore. Green spaces such as the Central Catchment Area were left untouched and there were plans to increase Singapore's green spaces from 2,500 ha to 4,500 ha. As such we can see a region of cooler surface temperature in Singapore's central region.

The Central Business District (CBD) of Singapore in the southeastern region, Jurong (western region) and Jurong Islands (Singapore's offshore island in the west) reflected areas of higher temperature compared to the rest of the city. Decentralising the urban centre from the CBD area to Jurong may have helped reduce temperature increase in the southeast region of Singapore, but led to pockets of higher heat in the west. Jurong Island, being a heavily industrialised area, was not spared the experience of higher heat despite being surrounded by water.",,,,

2020,,,,,,,,"From the graph below, we can see that Singapore's average  and minimum temperatures have increased by around 2℃ from the beginning of our record-keeping. The rapid increase in population resulting in the need for greater hard infrastructure has contributed through the Urban Heat Island effect to  the overall temperature  rise. Urban planning has thus played a major role in shaping the urban thermal environment, including setting aside green spaces to keep some areas of Singapore cooler.
<br/>
Nonetheless, as the earth continues to warm, the extent and intensity of urban heat in Singapore will be further amplified. This will not only affect the liveability of Singapore, it will also create health issues. Singapore will need to develop even more effective ways to mitigate heat, as time is running out.",,,,
