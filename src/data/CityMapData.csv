1820,,,,,,,,,"The first weather observations made in the Malayan peninsula were of temperature and wind. They were made by military officers of the English East India Company. There is no record of rainfall, probably because they were using measuring instruments they had been using on their ships to chart the weather during their voyage: ships did not carry rain gauges. They had a vested interest in studying the local weather to explore the viability of making a permenent settlement. After a settlement was established, doctors quickly took an interest in making observations. They were concerned about the 'healthiness' of the region for European colonisation and linked good weather with good health (Ward, 1830). ",1820

Guided by the British Association for the Advancement of Science (BAAS) and the Royal Society in London, a formal observatory was established in Singapore. Run by Lieutenant Charles Elliot, an EEIC officer, it was Singapore's first semi-permanent research station to investigate magnetism, astronomy and weather.
Located along Kallang River, Elliot's observatory was described as small but well designed for making weather observations. Direct sunlight was prevented from reaching the meteorological instruments and the walls were 18 inches thick and painted white in order to reflect heat (Elliot, 1849). 
The observatory was closed in 1845 due to the withdrawal of funds from London. The instruments were sent to India for re-use in the observatory in Bombay.",,"C. M. Elliot, Singapore Magnetic Observatory Yearbook",,1841

1869,,,,,,,,,"In 1869, meteorology for the Straits Settlements was brought under the control of the Medical Department for historic and practical reasons. Firstly, the interest in medical meteorology, a field of medical research that based its investigations on connections between health and weather, grew in the 19th century. As the century progressed, a quantitative method of comparing diseases incidence with meteorological data became common across the colonies of the British Empire (e.g. Walker, 1876, 1925).  Secondly, the medical department also offered a coherent infrastructure for the systematic collation of observations within a controlled environment.

This hospital was originally intended to hold transported prisoners (mainly of Indian origin) from other British colonies. The weather data is very detailed and standardised, observations made 3 times a day. 
Despite the detailed records, little in known about the small-scale observatory or who made the records. The prison itself was designed and established by George Coleman, Superintendent of Public Works and of Convicts. There was an open plan area with numerous workshops and studio, one of which was presumably an observatory space (McNair & Bayliss, 1889). 
Coleman handed operations to his successor, Major John Fedrick McNair, also a prominent architect and engineer. McNair may have supervised a subordinate or even a trusted prisoner to make the observations but they were ultimately signed off by the Colonial Surgeon, H.L. Randall. 
In 1867, the practice of transporting prisoners ended and six years later, so did the observations from this hospital.",,"Principal Civil Medical Officer (P.C.M.O) of
